<img src="https://github.com/samirpegado/calculator-app/blob/main/calculator.gif" width="200">

Calculator App is a simple yet powerful calculator application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Throughout this project, we had the opportunity to put several essential tools into practice, including ViewModel and States.

## Features

In this project, we utilized the following Jetpack Compose features:

- **ViewModel**: We implemented ViewModel to manage the app's data separately from the UI. This architectural pattern promotes better code organization and state management, allowing us to handle complex calculator logic efficiently.

- **States**: States were effectively used to manage the different states of the calculator, such as the input values and the result display. This ensured a seamless user experience and a responsive UI.

## How to Use the App

To run the project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Install Android Studio, if you don't already have it.
2. Download the sample or clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/samirpegado/calculator-app.git)
3. Import the sample into Android Studio.
4. Build and run the sample.
